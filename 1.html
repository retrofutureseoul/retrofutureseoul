<u><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrofuturism/" target="_blank" title="rf">Retrofuturism</a></strong></u>
(adjective retrofuturistic or retrofuture) is a movement in the creative arts showing the influence of depictions of the future produced in an earlier era.
<p>If futurism is sometimes called a "science" bent on anticipating what will come, retrofuturism is the remembering of that anticipation.</p><p style="margin-top:45px;">Characterized by a blend of old-fashioned "retro styles" with futuristic technology,
retrofuturism explores the themes of tension between past and future, and between the alienating and empowering effects of technology.</p>Primarily reflected in artistic creations and modified technologies that realize the imagined artifacts of its parallel reality,
retrofuturism can be seen as "an animating perspective on the world".
